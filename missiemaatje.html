								<h2>Overview</h2>

								<p class="post featured">
									
									In the scope of our "Applied Games" course, me and team of four other people were tasked with making a game for a client, called Veilig Huis.
									<h2>Who are Veilig Huis?</h2>

									Veilig huis is a non-profit organization focused on helping children that are victims of domestic abuse.
									<br>
									For this purpose they needed a game that would help them identify the support figure of the child (the adult they feel safe around),
									as well as track the evolution of the mental state of the child. You can find out more about them on <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/veilig-huis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="color-blue" download>their website</a>.

									<h2>My role in the team</h2>
									During this project, I focused on the art as well as the programming side of things.
									<br>
									Programming wise, I was responsible for implementing the save system, the reports system that saves
									an overview of every minigame, as well as the room customization and the unlocks.
									<br>
									Art wise, I made almost all of the 3D art, from the models, to the textures and the shaders.
									<br>
									Furthermore, I also helped quite a lot in other various departments, such as helping the game design team implement the feedback we recieved
									from our multiple feedback sessions.

									<h2>The results</h2>
									At the end of the 6 months of work, we ended up with a product our client was very happy with, and that they are now actively using in their
									mission. If you want to play the game for yourself, check out the <a href="https://kaspervdv125.itch.io/missie-maatje" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="color-blue" download>itch.io page.</a>
