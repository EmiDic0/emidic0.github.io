									<h1>The Robuddy</h1>
									<p>Who has never dreamed of a little robot assistant that would help you in the most mundane of tasks, and being cute while doing so? Introducting the window cleaner robuddy, that will help you clean you windows 
										and put a smile on your face.

								<p class="post featured">This adorable robuddy was entirely made by me. I followed a "high to low" workflow, which means this model is a lot more optimized than it looks. I started by making the high polygon version in Blender
									of the model, then I made the low polygon version, and finally, I baked the high polygon details onto the low polygon model. This way, the model looks very detailed, but is actually very light and easy to animate.
									<br>
									<br>

									Once the model was finished, I moved on to texturing, which was done using PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures. This means that the textures are made to be as realistic as possible, and react to light in a convincing way. This process was made in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.
									<br>
									<br>

									Finally, I rigged the model, which means I added a skeleton to it, so that it can be animated. I also animated the model, so that it can move around and clean windows. The animation was done in Blender.
