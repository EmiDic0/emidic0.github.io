								<h2>Overview</h2>

								<p class="post featured">
									This fun and whacky coop game was made for the DAE 2025 Creaweek Game Jam, with the theme "Spread it".
									It got second place for the community award, and first place for the jury award. The objective of  the game is to collaborate with y our friend to make the best
									peanut butter and jelly sandwich using a variety of mechanics such as toasting the bread, cutting it, and of course spreading the jelly and the peanut butter.
									If you wish to try the game for yourself, you can visit our <a href="https://colinberens.itch.io/twoleftjams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="color-blue" download>itch.io page</a> to download it.
									
									<h2>My role in the team</h2>
									During this project my roles were varied (as is often the case with a game jam).
									I was first tasked with creating all of the 3D assets for the game.
									Luckily, we already had a toon shader that we could apply to the game to
									give it a defining art style easily.
									<br>
									One issue I ran into was that the textures lost all of their detail once the toon shader was applied, which I fixed by
									using a clever combination of single color and gradient textures to maintain readability and avoid clutter. This workflow
									also allowed me to save quite a lot of time.
									<br>
									<br>
									Next, I was assigned to programming duty, where I squashed a lot of bugs, and implemented multiple mechanics such as the handwashing,
									breadcutting and the bread toasting.

									<h2>The results</h2>
									<p>
									In the end, our project ended up getting first place for the jury award, and second place for the community award, being only slightly behind first place.
