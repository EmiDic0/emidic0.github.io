									This game is the result of a two day game jam with the theme "Nature always wins", where me and two friends decided to make our submission a tower defense game. I was responsible for most of the programming of the game, as well as the designing of the mechanics. The game was made in Unity, and all the assets were made by us. If you want to try it out for yourself, you can find it on <a href="https://moonipuss.itch.io/slother" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="color-blue">itch.io</a>.
